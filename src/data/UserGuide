 Bluevia client module definition

 Introduction

    Bluevia Ruby SDK allows you to use the BlueVia public API from your Ruby
    application using just a few lines of code. You only need to download the 
    SDK, include it into your LOAD_PATH directory and leave magic work for you. 
    
    If you download the gem this should be automatically included in your gem 
    local repository. You only have to go to directory where bluevia-1.6.gem is 
    located and do:
    
       gem install bluevia-1.6.gem  
    
    and include require 'bluevia' in your program.

    When you want to use as developer Bluevia public APIs,
    first of all you need to get a commercial or testing API Key.
 
    Ruby SDK wraps any request to BlueVia endpoint by using an specific client 
    for every API (oAuth, SMS, Directory...).
 
 Getting Started
    
    The Bluevia library for Ruby has been tested to develop applications under 
    Ruby 1.8.7 and 1.9.2 versions with RVM 1.0.1. The following system requirements are 
    the ones your computer needs to meet to be able to work with Bluevia SDK:

	Supported Operating Systems

 	   Linux (tested on Linux Ubuntu 10.10)
 	   Windows XP (32-bit) or Vista (32- or 64-bit) (not tested)
 	   Mac OS X 10.5.8 or later (x86 only) (not tested)
 
	Eclipse IDE
	   
	   Eclipse 3.6.2
	   Eclipse RDT plugin, (tested on Aptana RDT 1.4.0)
 
    Find below the gem dependencies required by Bluevia SDK:

       - httpclient: used to create HTTP requests
       - oauth: generic gem to launch the oAuth process
       - nokogiri: used to parse XML responses (Advertising)
       - json_pure: used to parse JSON responses
       - multipart-post : used to send multipart MMS
       - multipart_body : used to prepare multipart bodys for MMS
       - rack : used to parse multipart MMS
	
	1. Preparing Ruby environment
	   
	   First step to start developing applications is setting up your Ruby environment 
	   (what is described below is just an example of ruby environment). 
	   
	   - Download a valid library for Ruby (tested on 1.8.7 and 1.9.2) 
	     from http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/. 
	   - RubyGems: no action necessary (usually installed with Ruby). 
	   - Aptana: Now that you have a working, documented version of Ruby 
	     on your computer, you need to download a new version or update your Eclipse 
	     plug-in, follow Aptana's instructions, which will be familiar to 
	     Eclipse users (http://update1.aptana.org/rails/1.2.1.23268/index.html).  
	   
	2. Downloading Bluevia SDK for Ruby
	
	   If you download the gem this should be automatically included in your gem 
	   local repository. You only have to go to directory where bluevia-1.6.gem is 
	   located and do:
    
       gem install bluevia-1.6.gem
       
       Also include require 'bluevia' in your program.  

	   If you want you can use bundler to deploy the gem. You only have to download 
	   the gem, open a command window and type: 
	      
	      gem install bundler (if not installed)
	      bundle install
	   
	   Follow the next steps to set up your Ruby project:
	   
	      - If you have Ruby plugin installed you have to select: 
	        File -> New -> Ruby Project
	      - Check that RubyVM for ruby 1.9.2 is selected (in case you have more RubyVM 
	      	installed).  
	      - Add Bluevia Library to your project (if needed) to your external resources 
			and include require 'bluevia' in your program.
 
 Programming guidelines     
    
    This section is a basic introduction to the Bluevia framework. This guide explains 
    the library behavior and architecture, its working modes and the security model, 
    based in OAuth, and how to start developing and testing Ruby applications using the 
    Bluevia APIs.
     
    In the API guides section several complete code examples for each API will be provided.
    Also some ruby demos are provided together with bluevia gem in order to test 
    bluevia features.
     
    In order to complete the documentation of the Bluevia SDK, you should check the 
    Reference section for API specifications.

	1. Bluevia library framework
	   
	   Bluevia library for Ruby architecture is mainly composed of three layers:
	   
	      - A connector, that performs the low level operations required to retrieve 
	        data from the remote servers. This layer is responsible for generating and 
	        propagating exceptions or error codes to the upper levels.
	      - A clients layer. This layer provides specific clients for the different APIs. 
	        Every API in Bluevia inherits from the same client, implementing the particular 
	        logic for each API in the final client that is also the final interface for 
	        users. Those final specific clients filter any data received from the remote 
	        server and populate the data model objects in the library with any data received.
	      - A parsing and serializing layer. This layer is responsible for the translation 
	      	from hash to XML, JSON or urlencoded depending on the API and viceversa. 
	   
	   A new Bluevia::Schemas module has been provided in order to help developpers with 
	   new objects.

	2. Clients basics
	   
	   Main component of Bluevia SDK is the Bluevia Client, which represents the client 
	   side in a classic client-server schema. Library specify a REST/RPC Client for each 
	   of the supported APIs (i.e. BVDirectory, BVMtSms), and defines operations provided 
	   by their respective Bluevia APIs.

	   According to this, Bluevia library presents an easy programming model, concealing 
	   the communication mechanism from the developer. The way of working is:
	   
	      - First, instantiate the corresponding client. You must provide the communication
	      	mechanism (as will be seen below) and the authorization information.
	      - Now use operations defined by the client.
	   
	   This snippet shows the easier way to create every existing bluevia client with
	   valid credentials that identify the application:
	   
	      require 'bluevia'
	      
	      include Bluevia
	      
	      #two legged oauth client
	      @bc = BVOauth.new(BVMode::LIVE, "[CONSUMER_KEY]","[CONSUMER_SECRET]")
	      	
	3. Working modes

	   Bluevia SDK provides several modes for each REST/RPC client. LIVE, TEST and SANDBOX 
	   are the actual communication mechanism with BlueVia, which provides the functionality 
	   described by the APIs. 
	   
	      - LIVE:In the Live environment your application uses the real network, which means that you 
	      	will be able to send real transactions to real Movistar, O2 and Vivo customers in the 
	      	applicable country.
	      - SANDBOX:The Sandbox environment offers you the exact same experience as the Live environment 
	      	except that no traffic is generated on the live network, meaning you can experiment and play 
	      	until your heart's content.
	      - TEST:The Test mode behave exactly like the Live mode, but the API calls are free of chargue, 
	      	using a credits system. You are required to have a Movistar, O2 or Vivo mobile number to 
	      	get this monthly credits.
	   
	   Developer can change mode just setting the desired behavior in the client:
	   
	   @mo = BVMoSms.new("LIVE","[CONSUMER_KEY]","[CONSUMER_SECRET]")
	   
	   Class BVMode has been provided to ease client configuration as follows:
	   
	   @mo = BVMoSms.new(BVMode::SANDBOX,"[CONSUMER_KEY]","[CONSUMER_SECRET]") 

	4. API Authentication
	   
	   BlueVia requires both user and your application to be identified and authenticated
	   to allow applications use its APIs. BlueVia supports OAuth Protocol, a token-passing
	   mechanims where users never have to reveal their passwords or credentials to the
	   application. Bluevia library implements an OAuth client to supply developers an easy
	   access to authentication procedure.
	   
	   If you want to learn more about oAuth please check this URL: http://oauth.net.
 
 Using Bluevia especific clients to launch requests
 
    Most of requests when accessing Bluevia API are associated to a specific user,
    so when a BV client object is created both user token and 
    user secret must be provided to identify user on behalf of
    whom the application wants to access BlueVia APIs.
    
    See different ways of creating BV Clients depending on the kind of authorization 
    for each API (some of them support both two-legged and three-legged oauth)
    
    # two-legged oauth client
      @bc = BVOauth.new(BVMode::LIVE, "[CONSUMER_KEY]","[CONSUMER_SECRET]")
        
    # two-legged advertising client
      @bc = BVAdvertising.new(BVMode::LIVE, "[CONSUMER_KEY]","[CONSUMER_SECRET]")
       
    # three-legged advertising client
      @bc = BVAdvertising.new(BVMode::LIVE, "[CONSUMER_KEY]","[CONSUMER_SECRET]",
      							"[TOKEN_KEY]","[TOKEN_SECRET]")
        
    # three-legged directory client
      @bc = BVDirectory.new(BVMode::LIVE, "[CONSUMER_KEY]","[CONSUMER_SECRET]",
      							"[TOKEN_KEY]","[TOKEN_SECRET]")
        
    # three-legged location client
      @bc = BVLocation.new(BVMode::LIVE,"[CONSUMER_KEY]","[CONSUMER_SECRET]")
        
    # three-legged sms client (Mobile Terminated)
      @bc = BVMtSms.new(BVMode::LIVE,"[CONSUMER_KEY]","[CONSUMER_SECRET]",
      							"[TOKEN_KEY]","[TOKEN_SECRET]")
        
    # three-legged mms client (Mobile Terminated)
      @bc = BVMtMms.new(BVMode::LIVE,"[CONSUMER_KEY]","[CONSUMER_SECRET]",
      							"[TOKEN_KEY]","[TOKEN_SECRET]")
        
    # two-legged sms client (Mobile Originated)
      @bc = BVMoSms.new(BVMode::LIVE,"[CONSUMER_KEY]","[CONSUMER_SECRET]")
		
	# two-legged mms client (Mobile Originated)
      @bc = BVMoMms.new(BVMode::LIVE,"[CONSUMER_KEY]","[CONSUMER_SECRET]")
        
    # two-legged payment client
      @bc = BVPayment.new(BVMode::LIVE,"[CONSUMER_KEY]","[CONSUMER_SECRET]")
    
    For every client, diferent functionality and methods are provided. See below some
    information about specific clients features. If more information is needed about 
    specific parameters, see documentation provided in every method.
