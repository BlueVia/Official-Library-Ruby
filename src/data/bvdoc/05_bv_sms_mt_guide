 Bluevia SMS Mobile Terminated client Guide

 Introduction

    The Bluevia SMS API is a set of functions which allows users to send SMS 
    messages and to request the status of those previously sent SMS messages. 
    This guide represents a practical introduction to developing applications 
    in which the user wants to provide the Bluevia SMS functionality.

 SMS MT client basics
	
	A SMS MT client represents the client side in a classic client-server schema. 
	This object wraps up the underlying REST client side functionality needed to 
	perform requests against a REST server. 

	Any Bluevia client performs requests and receives responses in a secure mode. 
	Clients are authorized following the OAuth protocol. This security protocol 
	enables users to grant third-party access to their resources without sharing 
	their passwords. So clients store the authorization data -called security 
	credentials- to grant access to the server. 
	
	Following sections describe the security credentials we are talking about.
	
 Creating a SMS MT client: BVMtSms class 
 
    First step for using Bluevia's SMS Mobile Terminated features is to create a 
    BVMtSms object. 
 	
    This object can have three different working modes: 
    
    - LIVE or BVMODE::LIVE Your application uses real network, which means that you 
      will be able to send real transactions to real Movistar, O2 and Vivo customers 
      in the applicable country.
    - TEST or BVMODE::TEST Behave exactly likes Live mode, but API calls are free
      of chargue, using a credits system. You are required to have a Movistar, O2 
      or Vivo mobile number to get this monthly credits.
    - SANDBOX or BVMODE::SANDBOX Sandbox environment offers you the exact same 
      experience as Live environment except that no traffic is generated on live network.
 
 SMS MT client features: security credentials

    Bluevia uses OAuth as its authentication mechanism which enables websites and 
    applications to access Bluevia API's without end users disclosing their personal 
    credentials.
    
    In order to grant access to the server any client has to be created passing the 
    security credential as parameter in its constructor. These security credentials 
    are managed internally and added as a HTTP header in every request sent to the server. 
    Such Oauth security credentials are:
	
	- Consumer key: String identifying the application (obtained when you registered 
	  your application within the provisioning portal.
	- Consumer secret: A secret -a string- used by the consumer to establish ownership 
	  of the consumer key
	- Access token: Token -a string- used by the client for granting access permissions 
	  to the server.
	- Access token secret: The secret of the access token.
 
 SMS MT client features: code example
 	
    Find below an example on how to create an Oauth 3-legged SMS MT client taking 
    into account all the information previously given.
	
    # three-legged SMS MT client
    @bc = BVMtSms.new(BVMode::LIVE, "[CONSUMER_KEY]","[CONSUMER_SECRET]",
    						"[TOKEN_KEY]","[TOKEN_SECRET]") 	

 Sending SMS messages

    The BVMtSms object allows sending SMS messages through 'send' method. 
    By means of this feature an user can send SMS to one or more phone numbers, 
    and to include an endpoint to receive delivery status notifications.

    Take a look at this function:
	
      def send(destination, text, endpoint = nil, correlator = nil)
	
    It sends a text message to a list of destinations (destination can be an array). 
    Endpoint and correlator are optional parameters and are included to receive 
    status notifications. 
	
    This function returns the SMS Id which indentifies that sending operation. 
    This identification is useful to retrieve the delivery status of that SMS message
    using a polling method.

 Requesting the status of a previously sent SMS messages

	Once SMS message is sent successfully user may want to know the delivery status 
	of that SMS message. Sms client allows an user to determine if the SMS message 
	reaches destination or not. 'get_deliver_status' method is created for this. 
	Just needs this SMS Id -returned by the send function- and retrieve the delivery 
	status of that message, so easy!.

 	Take a look at this function:
 	
 	  def get_delivery_status (message_id)
 	
 	It obtains the delivery status of a previously sent SMS message.

	There are six possible delivery statuses and they are accesible through 
	Bluevia::BVDELIVERYSTATUSMESSAGES array:
	
	- DeliveredToNetwork.
	- DeliveryUncertain.
	- DeliveryImpossible.
	- MessageWaiting.
	- DeliveredToTerminal.
	- DeliveryNotificationNotSupported.

 Bluevia SMS MT API: code example

    begin
	
      # 1. Create the client (you have to choose the mode and include the OAuth 
      authorization values)
  	  
      @bc = BVMtSms.new(BVMode::LIVE, "[CONSUMER_KEY]","[CONSUMER_SECRET]",
    						"[TOKEN_KEY]","[TOKEN_SECRET]")
      # 2. Send the message.
      sms_id = @bc.send("600010101", "This is the text to be sent using Bluevia API")

      # 3. Retrieve the delivery status of the sent SMS.
      # get_delivery_status returns an array of Bluevia::Schemas::DeliveryInfo objects
      status_obj = @bc.get_delivery_status(sms_id)
	  
      status_obj.each{ |info_sms|
        dest = info_sms.destination
        stat = info_sms.status
        desc = info_sms.status_description
        }
	
    rescue BlueviaError => e
      puts e.code
      puts e.message
      # as for example
    end
